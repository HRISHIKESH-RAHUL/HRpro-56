                <p>Live in each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and resign yourself to the influence of the earth—Henry David Thoreau </p>

                <p>Nature’s first green is gold, Her hardest hue to hold. Her early leaf’s a flower; But only so an hour. Then leaf subsides to leaf. So Eden sank to grief, So dawn goes down to day. Nothing gold can stay—Robert Frost</p>

                <p>The tides are in our veins, we still mirror the stars, life is your child, but there is in me, older and harder than life and more impartial, the eye that watched before there was an ocean—Robinson Jeffers</p>
